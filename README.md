# Django Monitoring System with Celery & Redis

A robust monitoring application built with Django that leverages Celery for asynchronous task processing and Redis as a high-performance message broker. This system runs continuous background monitoring tasks to track user metrics in real-time.

## üåü Key Features

**Backend Architecture**
- Django framework providing a solid web foundation
- Celery integration for distributed task processing
- Redis serving as both message broker and result backend
- Automated periodic monitoring with configurable intervals

**Monitoring Capabilities**
- Real-time user count tracking
- Background task execution without blocking the main application
- Scalable task distribution across multiple workers
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed on your system.

### Step 1: Project Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd monitor_project

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Redis Installation & Configuration

**For macOS users:**
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**For Ubuntu/Debian users:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```

**For Windows users:**
Download and install Redis from the [official website](https://redis.io/download) or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

**Verify Redis installation:**
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Expected response: PONG
```

### Step 3: Database Configuration
```bash
# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Step 4: Launch the Application

**Terminal 1 - Start Celery Worker & Beat:**
```bash
celery -A monitor_project worker --beat --scheduler django --loglevel=info
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Django Development Server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## üìà System Monitoring

Once the system is running, the monitoring task will automatically execute every 10 seconds. You'll see output similar to:

```
[2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX,XXX: INFO/MainProcess] [CELERY MONITOR] Current user count: 12
[2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX,XXX: INFO/MainProcess] [CELERY MONITOR] System status: Active
[2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX,XXX: INFO/MainProcess] [CELERY MONITOR] Current user count: 15
```

### Customizing Monitoring Intervals
To modify the monitoring frequency, update the periodic task configuration in your Django settings or Celery beat schedule.

## üìã Dependencies

**Core Requirements:**
- `Django>=4.2.0` - Web framework
- `celery>=5.3.0` - Distributed task queue
- `redis>=4.5.0` - In-memory data structure store
- `django-celery-beat` - Database-backed periodic tasks

**Development Tools:**
- `django-extensions` - Additional Django management commands
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production environments, consider:

- Using a dedicated Redis instance or cluster
- Configuring Celery with multiple workers
- Implementing proper logging and monitoring
- Setting up process supervision (systemd, supervisor)
- Using a production WSGI server like Gunicorn

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Redis Connection Error:** Ensure Redis server is running on the default port (6379)
2. **Celery Tasks Not Executing:** Verify that the Celery worker is started with the correct project configuration
3. **Database Errors:** Run `python manage.py migrate` to ensure all migrations are applied

**Health Check:**
```bash
# Test Redis connectivity
redis-cli ping

# Check Celery worker status
celery -A monitor_project inspect active
```
